I am a doctoral student in **Fluid Dynamics** with interests in *Tubulence*, *Multiphase flows*. During my studies I developed good skills in *Python* and *Matlab* coding. While working for my doctoral thesis I came across *Machine learning* tools which I applied on my problem. I found *machine learning* interesting and dedicated time in learning it. Currently I am interested in applying ML in fluid dynamics as I believe ML can provide new possibilities for dimensionality reduction and reduced-order modeling in fluid mechanics by providing a concise framework that complements and extends existing methodologies.
